BudMan budget manager application for Nordea and OP bank accounts is a React app created to analyze the household income and expenditure through bank account statements. BudMan will create easy to read graphs with automatic categorization of every imported transaction. The application has no online capabilities for security reasons so bank account statements have to be manually downloaded. After importing the statements to the application they are saved locally as JSON files.

## DONE

- Bank statement import and parsing from both OP and Nordea into JSON

## TODO

- Actual GUI
- Graphs
- Categorization
